# 3D Image Ray Tracer

Welcome to the 3D Image Ray Tracer project, a comprehensive exploration of computer graphics and ray tracing. This project, developed as part of an Introduction to Software Engineering course, comprises various stages, each contributing to the evolution of a sophisticated 3D rendering engine.

## Project Stages
1. **Primitives and Geometries**\
  Lay the foundation by implementing basic primitives and geometries crucial for 3D rendering.
2. **Unit Tests and Normal Calculations**\
  Ensure accuracy and reliability with thorough unit testing and precise normal calculations.
3. **Ray-Geometry Intersections**\
  Introduce the critical concept of ray-geometry intersections, enabling the simulation of light interactions with 3D objects.
4. **Camera, Ray Casting**\
  Implement the camera and ray casting functionalities, allowing for the creation of perspectives within the scene.
5. **Color, Scene, Rendering, Ray Tracing**\
  Dive into the heart of ray tracing, handling colors, scenes, and rendering for realistic image generation.
6. **Material, Light Sources, Simplified Phong Model**\
  Enhance realism with materials, light sources, and a simplified Phong lighting model.
7. **Shadows, Reflection & Refraction (Transparency)**\
  Introduce shadows and explore the complexities of reflections and transparency for more lifelike scenes.
8. **Glossy Surfaces and Diffused (Blurry) Glass (Supersampling)**\
  Elevate the visual experience with glossy surfaces, diffused glass, and efficient supersampling techniques.
9. **Multithreading and Adaptive Supersampling**\
  Optimize performance through multithreading and implement adaptive supersampling for smoother image quality.

## Project Overview
This 3D image renderer utilizes ray tracing to generate captivating images, incorporating advanced features such as glossy and blurry glass, reflection, refraction, and shadows. Supersampling is employed to achieve the glossy and blurry glass effects.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Rendering Techniques**: Glossy surfaces, diffused (blurry) glass, reflection, refraction, and shadows.
- **Object-Oriented Modelling**: Utilizes vectors and points created by the programmer, demonstrating a mastery of object-oriented principles.
- **Agile Methodology**: Embraces Agile methodologies, including refactoring, Test-Driven-Development, and pair programming.
- **SOLID Principles**: Adheres to SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code.
